1. **Service/Tool Name**: What service or functionality will this MCP server provide?

2. **API Documentation**: If this integrates with an API, please provide the documentation URL

3. **Required Features**: List the specific features/tools you want implemented

4. **Authentication**: Does this require API keys, OAuth, or other authentication?

5. **Data Sources**: Will this access files, databases, APIs, or other data sources?

Build an MCP server that can expose the Sports API, see attached OAS file. This is a demo for education purposes. 

If any information is missing or unclear, I will ask for clarification before proceeding.
